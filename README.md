This project is an end-to-end Breast Cancer Diagnostic Data Science System built using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. It encompasses a complete data science pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning model training, and evaluation. The system integrates multiple classification models and a semi-fuzzy logic layer to provide interpretable results. The project also features an intuitive Streamlit dashboard for real-time predictions and visual explanations of the model's decision-making process. This tool serves as a foundation for a broader Automated Data Scientist Tool aimed at making machine learning accessible to non-technical users.
